                There are six steward positions (one from each guild and two from the core DAO community) and each term lasts 180 days before a new election.
                <br />
                <br />
                The primary role of the DAO Stewards is to support the growth of the DAO and engage consistently in DAO voting via delegation.

                This page provides details of each DAO steward and tracks their contributions within the DAO over time.
                <br />
                <br />
                Members can also use the delegation facilitaty on this page to enable Stewards to vote on their behalf.
